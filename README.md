## Project Description

I created an application that allows users to:

- View their current monthly financial state.
- Add, delete update transactions.
- Calculate total expenses, incomes, and state.
- Visualize what comprises their income or expenses and how they compare.
- Optionally add an 'expected by' date for incomes or a 'due by' date for expenses.
